					After Week 2 established the first backend and UI pieces, Week 3 focused on making those
					pieces more dependable. I worked on the extraction/statistics API, connected the project
					to a real CI workflow, fixed a Java compatibility issue, and spent time debugging the
					extraction framework with Amharic-specific inputs. The debugging work was especially
					useful because it showed the difference between a feature working in a clean demo and a
					feature surviving real multilingual data.

					What the extraction-framework debugging revealed
				</h2>
				<p class="mt-5">
					The hardest part of the week was not only wiring the API. It was understanding why
					extraction can fail on real Amharic content. These failures are valuable because they
					point to the places where our mapping work, templates, language configuration, and
					ontology assumptions need to become more precise.

					The practical lesson
				</h2>
				<p class="mt-5">
					Week 3 made the project feel more real. The website now has CI, the backend has a clearer
					extraction/statistics path, and the extraction framework issues are becoming specific
					enough to debug instead of vague enough to ignore. The next step is to keep turning those
					findings into fixes: cleaner templates, better language-code handling, more robust
					mappings, and API behavior that explains failures instead of hiding them.
